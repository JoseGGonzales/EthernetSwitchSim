# EthernetSwitchSim

Python program that simulates an Ethernet switch. It reads network frames from an input file (in.txt), processes them to learn MAC addresses, and forwards frames to the correct output ports based on the learned addresses. The final output (outgoing frames for each port) is written to out.txt.
